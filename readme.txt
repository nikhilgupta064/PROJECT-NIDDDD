In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to intrusion detection on NSL-KDD dataset. Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier are used as machine learning algorithms. In addition, all models were classified as Ensemble Learning. Accuracy comparisons of all models were performed.
